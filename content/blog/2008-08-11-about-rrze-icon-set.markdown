<h2>Introduction to the RRZE Icon Sets</h2>

<p> This icon collection includes, in particular, the topic </p>

<p> </p>

<ul>

  <li>"user administration" and </li>

  <li>further common IT-topics.</li>

</ul>

<p>There is one icon set with the different types of users and
one with various server applications. Additionaly, there are icons for
status notifications and classifications. The icons were created within
the <a class="externlink" href="http://www.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/forschung/abgeschlossene-projekte/idm_en.shtml" title="External Link: " target="_blank">RRZE Identity
Management Project</a> and are used amongst others for the <a class="externlink" href="http://www.blogs.uni-erlangen.de/IDM/topics/WAID/" title="External Link: " target="_blank">Web-Front-End
application</a>. </p>

<p> During the development, different styles - from comic via
simple grafic symbols to (almost) photo-realistic designs - were tried.
In the end, the nearly photo-realistic designs were chosen, because
they were found to have the best re-identification and looked the most
modern. </p>

<p> The current icons' style is based on the <a class="externlink" href="http://www.blogs.uni-erlangen.de/IDM/topics/WAID/" title="External Link: " target="_blank">Tango Desktop
Project</a>, but has been adjusted to the needs of the <acronym title="German abbriviation for Regional Computing Centre">RRZE</acronym>.
</p>

<p> The collection is continously expanding. </p>

<p> The icons are created with the open source software <a class="externlink" href="http://www.inkscape.org/" title="External Link: " target="_blank">Inkscape</a>
and are provided as ".<acronym title="scalable vector graphics">svg</acronym>"
as well as ".<acronym title="portable networks graphics">png</acronym>"
in different resolutions. They can be downloaded individually from the <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> or as a complete
icon-set from the <a href="download.html">download</a>
page. </p>
