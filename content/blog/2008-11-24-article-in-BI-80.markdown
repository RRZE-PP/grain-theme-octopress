		RRZE published icon set for free use &hellip; and they
		dance a tango. Without pictograms our virtual world would be impossible
		to imagine. You need &ldquo;icons&rdquo; - that is how they are
		called in the computer world - for data manager, interface, websites, a
		nicer desktop, for personal scripts and many more uses. Catchy, highly
		self explanatory and with a high re-identification rate, our icons
		provide our customer to identify with the offered products. From a wide
		range of icons at no charge, which are offered on the internet, one
		icon set stands out: the extensive and very uniformly created
		&ldquo;Tango Icon Set&rdquo; has been developed especially for
		Open Source applications and is available for the use in various
		topics. The RRZE has now created its own icon set and published it for
		free use on the internet. The icon collection is based on the field of
		IT-technology, especially for user administration. The collection
		includes, among other things, icons for different user types, server
		applications, status and classifications. The icons have been developed
		within the Identity Management Project (IDMone) where they are used for
		the user web front end. The collection will be continuously extended
		and can be downloaded under <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/RRZETangoSet" target="_blank">http://tango.freedesktop.org/RRZETangoSet</a>
		in .png and .svg format. It can also be used for personal projects. The
