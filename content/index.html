		<h2><strong>New: The monocrom Icon Set!</strong></h2>
		<p>
			<strong>The Regional Computing Centre of Erlangen (RRZE) presents a new icon set: monocrom. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			MONO, mon.crom, monocrome. Several times the name for the new, monochrome icon set has been changed.
			<br />
			monocrom finally is a new set, which (despite a few exceptions) consists of  completely white shapes.
			<br />
			Like the tango styled RRZE Icon Set, monocrom is also specialized for IT topics.
			<br />
			The reason for a new icon set was the revision of several RRZE's websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			To prevent the the new, clear design from being destroyed by colorful, flashy icons, new icons were necessary.
			<br />
			monocrom was born.
			<br />
			With concrete shapes, abstract processes and functions are shown, which are, though completely colorless, easily understandable for the user.
			<br />
			Bit by bit the icons from the RRZE Icon Set are going to be transfered to the monocrom set. To keep an overview the icons are divided into the following subfolders: actions, emblems, logos and status.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			The icons are available in .svg and .png format and can be downloaded directly from the <a href="http://rrze-icon-set.berlios.de/monocrom/gallery.html">TODO monocrom gallery</a>

		<p>
			The icon set is licensed under the <a class="externlink" rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative-Commons Attribution Share-Alike licence 3.0</a>.
			<br />
			Therefore interested designers can use the collection for their own creations, starting with this release.
